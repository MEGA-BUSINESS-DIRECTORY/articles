<p>
  If you're one of the lucky few with an income of £100k+ per year, then you’ll
  know that managing your tax situation can quickly become a headache. When your
  earnings reach that level, it’s no longer just about keeping track of your
  salary; there are investments, dividends, multiple income streams, and a whole
  host of deductions to consider. That’s where Pie comes in. The app offers a
  tailored tax experience for high earners, making it easier to handle the
  complexities of your finances without needing to consult an accountant every
  time a question arises.
</p>

<p>
  The beauty of Pie is that it’s designed to make tax management feel as simple
  as possible, even for those with complex financial situations. When you earn
  more, your tax situation naturally becomes more complicated, and that’s why
  Pie includes expert guidance right within the <a href="https://www.pie.tax" target="_blank"><b>Tax Calculator</b></a> app. You don’t need to be a tax
  pro to understand what’s going on with your taxes. Pie’s simple, intuitive
  design ensures that even if you have multiple income streams or investments,
  you can see your tax status at a glance, with expert checks in place to ensure
  nothing’s missed. The app will walk you through everything, from calculating
  tax on rental income to handling dividends, so you're never left in the dark.

<p>
  Another great feature for high earners is Pie’s real-time tax calculator. With
  high earnings, your tax obligations can change quickly, especially if you're
  lucky enough to get bonuses or stock options. Pie keeps track of your earnings
  as they come in, updating your tax figure in real time so that you always know
  where you stand. This means you won’t be blindsided by your tax bill come the
  end of the year. It’s as though you have a personal accountant with you at all
  times, providing you with the insight you need to make smart financial
  decisions throughout the year.
</p>

<p>
  One of the biggest perks of using Pie for high-income tax management is that
  it automates so much of the tedious work that used to require a lot of manual
  effort or consultation with a professional. The app will pull in data from all
  your sources of income and calculate everything for you. Whether it’s your
  PAYE salary, rental income, investment earnings, or something else, Pie will
  automatically reconcile your receipts and transactions to give you an
  up-to-date picture of your tax situation. You can say goodbye to the old days
  of spending hours gathering paperwork and receipts. Pie takes care of it all,
  leaving you with more time to focus on what matters.

<p>
  When you’re earning over £100k a year, you might also have more complicated
  deductions to keep track of, and that’s where Pie’s tailored advice really
  comes into play. The app offers personalised suggestions based on your
  specific tax situation, so you’re not left guessing about what expenses you
  can claim or what tax relief you might be eligible for. Whether it's pension
  contributions, charitable donations, or something specific to your line of
  work, Pie ensures you're always in the know, helping you optimise your tax
  bill so you pay exactly what you owe—and not a penny more.
</p>

<p>
  Pie doesn’t just offer great advice; it also makes the filing process
  incredibly simple. While doing a self-assessment as a high earner might have
  once meant hiring an accountant to wade through your records, Pie lets you
  handle the whole thing yourself—without any of the stress. The app even allows
  you to submit your self-assessment directly to HMRC, all for free. This cuts
  out the need for an expensive accountant to do the same job. For a fraction of
  the cost, you get the same level of accuracy and peace of mind that you’d
  expect from a professional. When you compare the cost of using Pie to hiring a
  high-end accountant, it’s easy to see why Pie is the preferred choice for many
  high earners.

<p>
  Not only does Pie save you money on professional fees, but it also offers
  excellent value by providing constant updates and guidance throughout the
  year. Rather than waiting until the end of the tax year to get your affairs in
  order, Pie keeps you up to date with your tax obligations in real time,
  reducing the risk of unexpected surprises. You’ll be able to make adjustments
  and plan ahead, which is especially helpful if your income fluctuates over the
  course of the year. Plus, Pie’s live tax figures mean you can always see how
  changes in your income or deductions will affect your final tax bill, making
  it easier to manage your finances proactively.
</p>

<p>
  The app’s features also make it incredibly flexible for those with a diverse
  income portfolio. For example, if you’re a high earner with investments in
  property, stocks, or crypto, Pie handles all the calculations involved in
  tracking your capital gains. It integrates with various financial platforms,
  pulling in your data to give you a complete picture of your earnings, taxes,
  and obligations. Whether you’re juggling multiple income streams or managing
  different types of assets, Pie helps keep everything organised and optimised
  for tax purposes.
</p>

<p>
  When you earn a high income, it’s common to have to make important financial
  decisions, such as whether to invest in a pension scheme, donate to charity,
  or buy a new property. Each of these decisions can affect your tax position.
  Pie’s built-in tools and expert guidance help you make those decisions with
  tax efficiency in mind. It doesn’t just calculate what you owe; it helps you
  maximise your tax savings through strategic decisions, ensuring you get the
  most out of your money while staying compliant with tax laws.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, Pie’s value for high earners is in its combination of convenience,
  accuracy, and expert insight. For a fraction of what you'd pay an accountant,
  you get access to tax calculations, real-time updates, tailored advice, and
  direct submissions to HMRC. It’s like having an accountant in your pocket,
  without the hefty price tag. Whether you’re managing multiple incomes,
  juggling investments, or navigating complex tax laws, Pie makes it easier to
  stay on top of your tax game. It takes the stress and confusion out of
  managing your taxes, allowing you to focus on what really matters: growing
  your wealth.
